# Handling Multiple Effects at Once

Sometimes the granularity of handlers does not coincide with the
granularity of effect signatures. For instance, we might want to
offer fine grained interfaces for reading and writing operations
but handle them together in one handler.

In this tutorial, we'll see that in **Effekt** it is very natural to
define such combined handlers. Let's start with defining the
effect signatures for `Reader` and `Writer`.

You can play around with the full source code for this example at this
[Scastie (Scala 2.12)](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/xsU2asSTQNiEI93ocjHpSg).

```scala mdoc:silent
import effekt._

trait Reader[S] {
  def read(): Control[S]
}
trait Writer[S] {
  def write(s: S): Control[Unit]
}
```

(We omit the standard companion object definitions as seen in the
earlier tutorials.)

## Defining the combined handler

Since handlers of algebraic effects are just implementations of
the effect signature traits it is not surprising that one handler
might implement multiple of such signatures. Below, we define a
simple handler for `Reader` and `Writer` that uses a list to mediate
between the two effects.

```scala mdoc:silent
def rwHandler[R, S] = new Handler[R] with Reader[S] with Writer[S] with State {

  // create a new field
  val out = Field(List.empty[S])

  def read() = out.value flatMap {
    case s :: rest => for {
      _ <- out.value = rest
    } yield s
    case _ => sys error "Not enough elements written to perform read"
  }

  def write(s: S) = for {
    rest <- out.value
    _ <- out.value = s :: rest
  } yield ()
}
```

## Example usage

To show the usage of the combined handler, let's first define a
simple example program.
```scala mdoc:silent
def example(implicit r: Reader[Int], w: Writer[Int]): Control[Int] =
  for {
    _ <- w.write(2)
    _ <- w.write(3)
    x <- r.read()
    _ <- w.write(x * 2)
    y <- r.read()
  } yield y
```

Handling the example with our combined handler, we get:

```scala mdoc
run {
  rwHandler handle { implicit rw: Reader[Int] with Writer[Int] =>
    example
  }
}
```
